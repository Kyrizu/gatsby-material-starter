It is now October, and it is getting closer to summer in the land down under. September was a wondrous month, I had to work on many projects although most of them had nothing to do with programming, they were still good learning experiences.

####**New Project for new learning**
I made a start on a project which was supposed to be a game with a school theme, but currently, I think I might add some spooky elements into it for the sake of the upcoming Halloween. I will also use it as my due date while organizing my workflow around it and create a proper schedule, furthermore, it will give it a purpose to exist in October.

The game was formerly a chance to learn about 2D games and then create some games with a basic art style. I might now just go all in and see what I create. I am horrible at arts and design so I might not make something good but, this can be a starting point. The spooky element will hopefully give it a unique style so it won't be that messy and I want to use it as my guide in this adventure. Also, a while back I read about the art of making a good horror movie, which might be useful anyway it will be a good learning experience.

####**Loving the new adventure**
It always feels exciting to start new projects that you never did before, I continually learn many new things but also find many new ways to use my existing knowledge. I guess the former increases your knowledge of the subject and after that, you get an elementary understanding. The latter improves your ability to apply your knowledge to a context and build things.

>After all, a skilled person is someone who can utilise the knowledge to create what is needed. The more ways you can apply your understanding the more proficient you are. 

#####**We got more opportunities to be better**
Lucky for us in programming, we can learn and practice at the same time, we are not limited by any barriers of entry to practice our knowledge and test our theories. This is the thing I love most about programming, actually not only that but, the fact that I could run simulations that let me comprehend the topics I was taught at school. My next project might be based on a subject I was taught at school. I wanted to test it out for quite some time now :)

Anyways I gotta start on this project, I always put off art and design projects because I am terrible at them. I don't have the artistic view then how about I use a logical approach to it? I don't even know how that would look like. But as long as I keep trying, I might find my own way of doing it. It is based on understanding how to practice and following that understanding. That is my current plan for this, and I find it fascinating how writing down my thoughts or at least the outline in my mind presents everything in a much clear form. Maybe due to the chaotic nature of my brain, I just have to write the small bits that I would forget about the new project.
